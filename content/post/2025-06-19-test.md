Hey everyone! I'm excited to share updates to my [blog post generator tool](https://github.com/dezryth/misc-scripts), a personal project I've been tinkering with to streamline my blogging process. You'll find some other potentially helpful random utils in that repo. As someone who wants to blog more consistently to share my coding journey and boost my career, I’ve been pouring love into this tool to make it more practical and user-friendly. Here's what's new in the latest iteration!

## Multi-Blog Support for Markdown Sites
One of the biggest upgrades is that the app now supports targeting multiple blog sites that use markdown files. You can configure the tool to handle different markdown-based platforms. This flexibility means I can manage multiple blogs without juggling separate workflows, which is a huge time-saver. I have this "professional" blog and a family blog, and both utilize different static site generating tools so this is very convenient for me.

## Binary Executables for Windows and macOS
To make the tool more accessible, I’ve added binary executables for both Windows and macOS to the [repository](https://github.com/dezryth/misc-scripts). No need to mess with setting up a development environment or installing dependencies—just download the executable, and you’re good to go. 

## Quality-of-Life Improvements
I’ve made a bunch of small but impactful improvements to make the experience smoother:
- **Smarter File Dialogs**: When you go to load an existing post to edit, the file dialog now opens directly to the posts directory specified in your configuration. No more hunting through folders to find your drafts!
- **Cleaner UI**: The user interface has gotten a bit of a facelift. It’s not a complete overhaul, but I’ve tweaked the layout and visuals to feel more polished and intuitive. Check out the latest look below.

Tangent but I threw together this silly image for testing and despite my better judgment here is what that looked like:

Anyways...

These changes might seem minor, but they add up to a tool that feels more like a helper than a hurdle.

## A Personal Project with a Purpose
At its core, this blog post generator is a personal project born out of my desire to blog more often. Between work, learning new tech, and life, finding time to write can be tough. By building a tool tailored to my needs, I’m removing friction from the process—whether it’s drafting markdown files, managing multiple blogs, or just making the UI a bit friendlier. My goal is to share more of my coding experiences, side projects, and insights to grow as a developer and connect with the tech community.

I also see this project as a way to showcase some of my python skills. It’s a real-world example of how I approach problem-solving, from designing a user-friendly interface to optimizing workflows for markdown-based blogging. Plus, it’s been a fun way to experiment with new tools and techniques!

## What’s Next?
I’m always looking for ways to improve this tool, so if you check out the [repository](https://github.com/dezryth/misc-scripts) and have ideas or feedback, I’d love to hear them. For now, I’m just happy to have a tool that makes blogging feel less like a chore and more like a creative outlet.

Thanks for reading, and stay tuned for more posts (hopefully written with the help of this very tool)!
