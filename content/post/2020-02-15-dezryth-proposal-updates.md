My proposal passed with 76.3% approval! ðŸŽ‰

I promised transparency with my [proposal](https://proposals.decred.org/proposals/063e38270b475ad680e98c12d1a48e322f4e8defe40b265272ea60c6d2202b13) and I intend to update this post with insight into the work over the months and a picture of the invoice sent to Decred's CMS system each month. This will be updated over time. Please bear with me as the format and level of description may fluctuate, and keep in mind that this level of disclosure to the public is rare.

### January

This was the first month of my proposal. I spent time each day reviewing new developments surrounding Decred and taking note of what was post-worthy. I've set up a work flow to keep track of posts to put together when I have time and posted 13 posts. This month was billed retro-actively and some work was done before my proposal was even live, let alone approved, so future months will have more activity. I did not attend an event in person this month, but keeping an eye open for events to attend in the future.
