Testing..

I would like to share that I've recently uploaded an application I wrote to my GitHub account that can be used to administer raffles. No longer will you have to hand-fill hundreds upon hundreds of tickets for your raffles! EZRaffle will insert as many entries as an entrant is entitled to along with their information. Upon submission, the entrant will optionally be sent an email confirming their entries.

It's written in C# and uses a light-weight SQLite database. This application is free to use and please feel free to contribute!
