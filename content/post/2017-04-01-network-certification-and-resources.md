I am currently training for the Network+ certification offered by [CompTia][1]. It's a vastly more interesting subject for me to review and familiarize myself with than A+ has been in the past. As for the moment I only have the money for one certification and I've decided to pursue this one first.

For anyone else interested in studying up for this or any other CompTia certifications, I highly recommend Professor Messer's YouTube Channel, which can be found [here][3].
