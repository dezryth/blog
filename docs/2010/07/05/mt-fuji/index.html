<h2 id="the-following-post-is-from-2010-i-imported-my-blog-posts-from-my-month-long-trip-to-japan-for-posterity-and-to-remember-fondly">(The following post is from 2010. I imported my blog posts from my month long trip to Japan for posterity and to remember fondly!)</h2>
<p>So when I was planning for my trip to see the area around Mt. Fuji, I never really thought i&rsquo;d end up climbing it.</p>
<p>Mr. Takata helped me to plan the fastest route of trains to Kawaguchiko, which leads up to the 5th station of Mt. Fuji. Even though I would be getting there around 12:30, it takes about 6-7 hours to climb mt. Fuji and longer on the way down. I was expecting to only explore the area around 5th station.</p>
<p>From Shinjuku station, I took the Holiday express all the way to Kawaguchiko, and on the way got many pictures from my seat.</p>
<p>Once I got to Kawaguchiko, I bought a round trip bus ticket to 5th station. On the bus, I sat next to this Japanese guy who started talking to me in Japanese. I learned that he had climbed mt. Fuji 30 times! And he showed me the stuff he had gotten over the years from climbing.</p>
<p>After the bus dropped us off at 5th station, the Japanese dude took me up the the shops and convinced me to buy a walking stick. On the way up Mt. Fuji, you can stop at the places on the way up and pay 200 yen for them to burn a stamp into your stick showing that you were there.</p>
<p>So after that I had a stick. And wherever I decided to go after that point, I would have to carry that stick anyways, so I decided I&rsquo;d hike up Mt. Fuji for a while. As soon as I was starting up I ran into a couple Americans. Everywhere else I had been there had been hardly anyone to talk to in English so I started up a conversation with them and asked if they were going to the top. They were, and we decided to go up together for a while. I still wasn&rsquo;t sure if I would go all the way because I wasn&rsquo;t very prepared, (I had my backpack, a jacket, and money) but I wanted to walk up for a while anyways and see what it was like.</p>
<p>The two people I met are in some of the pictures. Geoffrey Connor and his niece, Caitlyn. They were both really nice people! I found out later that Geoffrey Connor is a former Secretary of State of Texas! Also it turned out that Caitlyn used to live about an hour away from where I lived in NC! Kinda crazy how everything turned out on this trip.</p>
<p>Anyways at station 6, I decided I wanted to go to the top and bought a few things. I purchased a poncho set (which came with a top and pants), a pair of gloves and two water bottles. Then we continued up, expecting to find their room reservation somewhere near the 8th station.</p>
<p>As we walked, since I had the Japanese language experience I did the talking and reading for them when they needed to know something or purchase something. It was pretty cool being useful in that area, haha.</p>
<p>As we kept on trekking up, they had me look at a map and see if I could locate where the place they were staying was. Turned out that we had just past the place and had to hike back down to previous group of buildings. There I asked if they had room, and because it is really early in the season, they did. The place cost about 90 dollars for the night, and included dinner and a pack for breakfast.</p>
<p>For dinner (there is a picture) we had some kind of meat with rice, a small serving of pasta, and miso soup with some green tea to drink. At dinner we decided we would leave around 12:30 to try to catch the sunrise at the summit. The sun rises around 4:30-5 and it takes about 3-4 hours from where we were staying to reach the top.</p>
<p>The rooms hold about 20 people when its crowded. (Kinda weird, because I only saw 3 blankets per level of bunk bed) They contain two huge bunk beds a thin walkway between them to exit the room. It was impossible for me to fall asleep, and it started to rain around 8pm. Hard. I was in charge of waking them up in time, but it was raining so hard I wasn&rsquo;t sure if i should even bother waking them up. None of us were equipped for such heavy rain. Turns out they couldn&rsquo;t really fall asleep either and so got up on time anyways. After that, the rain started to die down. We got ready and headed to the entrance and left around 1:30, when the rain had completely stopped. It didn&rsquo;t rain for the rest of the trip.</p>
<p>We headed up. It was pretty dark, especially for me without any kind of flash light, but I just climbed close to Caitlyn and relied on my night vision. (It wasn&rsquo;t as slippery as I expected, but it was still hard to see) Sounds pretty dangerous, and yeah it kinda was haha! But somehow I managed to not fall down the entire climb or descent. I slipped a lot, but managed to catch myself each time. The walking stick really helped.</p>
<p>The air gets very thin, and if you over exert yourself you will get incredibly dizzy. We took many short breaks and just kept up a slow, steady pace. The wind was really strong near the top, and a few times I had to get a better footing to avoid getting blown over. My gloves were soaked as we reached the top. It was very cloudy and cold. We couldn&rsquo;t see anything! But we reached the top. The above picture is of me at the summit! I had to take my gloves off because they were completely soaked and my hands were freezing! The sun rose, but it wasn&rsquo;t as picturesque as we were hoping. It was completely cloudy and we could hardly see a thing. Also everything on the top was closed at the time.</p>
<p>After we took a few pictures we headed back down. The trip down is a lot harder on your knees, and I got sunburned towards the bottom of the mountain, but I was still proud of climbing the mountain. (Although at the same time kind of miserable and tired from lack of sleep and not being in the best shape)</p>
<p>We said goodbye at 5th station and I headed toward my bus stop. It was a fun trip. Next time I climb, I&rsquo;ll know what to expect and be better prepared.</p>
<p>That was good exercise.</p>
